POC models for webpack apps

I used this repo to test various builds of an app I had to migrate from AngularJs/Gulp to React/Webpack.

You can see my various attempts in the branches here.

### Framework Agnostic MPA models

* [Framework-Agnostic MPA with single bundle](https://github.com/slatron/webpack-examples/tree/mpa-agnostic-single-bundle)
* [Framework-Agnostic MPA with multiple bundles](https://github.com/slatron/webpack-examples/tree/mpa-agnostic-multiple-bundles)

### Angular and React MPA models

* [Angular MPA](https://github.com/slatron/webpack-examples/tree/mpa-angular)
* [React MPA](https://github.com/slatron/webpack-examples/tree/mpa-react)

### React + MPA Progressive Models

* [React MPA with styles, fonts and images](https://github.com/slatron/webpack-examples/tree/react-mpa-with-assets)
* [React MPA alongside AngularJS gulp](https://github.com/slatron/webpack-examples/tree/react-mpa-with-gulp)

## POCs ruled out by MPA + React decision

### ~~Agnostic webpack build alongside current gulp build~~

* ~~MPA agnostic gulp + webpack~~
* ~~SPA agnostic gulp + webpack~~

### ~~Webpack build alongside current gulp build in each framework~~

* ~~MPA agnostic gulp + webpack on React~~
* ~~MPA agnostic gulp + webpack on Angular~~
* ~~SPA agnostic gulp + webpack on React~~
* ~~SPA agnostic gulp + webpack on Angular~~
